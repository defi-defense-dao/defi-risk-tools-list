# DeFi Risk Tools & Resources

This is the first step in a larger initiative to create a collaborative DAO to increase safety and transparency for DeFi through a community-driven product risk history and scoring resource.

Providing a credible risk assessment platform helps highlight  innovators who are changing the future of finance without cutting corners. Not only does this help the average crypto participant make more intelligent decisions, but it also incentivizes individual projects to boost their overall security and trustworthiness.

Below is a list of the available tools, projects, and protocols for analyzing and managing risk within DeFi.

Note that this list is focused on technical, centralization, and liquidity risk of DeFi protocols, **NOT price risk of tokens.**

We hope that better sharing of tools, standards, and development patterns will support the safe growth of the DeFi ecosystem overall. We also hope that DeFi protocols, white hat hackers, developers, auditors, and users can unite around the common goal of making DeFi safer for current and future adopters.

To learn more, join the [DeFi Safety DAO Telegram group](https://t.me/DeFiSafetyDAO).

## Contributions are welcome!

Feel free to submit a pull request, with anything from small fixes to translations to tools you'd like to add (or remove!). If adding a new tool, **please add a brief description** that you think new developers would understand.

- Projects that do not have a working product should only be added to the _Coming Soon_ section.
- Projects that are deprecated or no longer maintained will be removed.
- Projects that are paid/restricted services without open-source code or developer reviews will be further vetted.

## The Basics of DeFi Risk

Building on the work of awesome projects like [DeFi Score](https://defiscore.io/), [DeFi Safety](https://defisafety.com/), and others, we believe that the systemic failure of large financial protocols is the biggest risk to a thriving DeFi community over the next few years.

Currently, some of the risks in DeFi include: 

- DeFi protocols range from fly-by-night scam operations to serious protocols challenging TradFi and it is often hard to tell these apart
- Many DeFi hacks have taken place and DeFi users have lost funds. Arguably this could have been prevented if objective risk information would have been available.
- Objective information about DeFi protocols is hard to find and scattered over different platforms. Investors have to do independent research by swivelling across various interfaces and data sources. 
- If objective information is available at all, it is centralised and often outdated


Protocols and smart contracts that contain large amounts of value face the following risks:

- Smart Contract Risk - Technical bugs that can expose funds to hackers.
- Centralization Risk - Centralized admin keys are stolen or used nefariously, or oracles are manipulated to allow an exploit.
- Financial Risk - Collateral falls below outstanding obligations, likely due to price movement, or low liquidity leads to locked funds.

The resources below list some common methods of failure. We hope that by educating and evangelizing the public, our community can eliminate or mitigate these vulnerabilities as more groundbreaking financial services are built in this space.

Eventually, a DeFi Safety DAO would seek to solve key issues by: 
*   Bringing together a suite of tools together that have been standalone until now.
*   Assessing and indicating risk across protocols.
*   Providing incentives to keep these metrics up to date and to improve quality and quantity of the underlying data.

## Potential Further Work and Tools

### Form DeFi Safety DAO

DeFi Safety DAO’s goal is to keep the DeFi space safe, robust, and grounded. It will be a community owned and operated comprehensive blockchain security analysis DAO. 

DeFi Safety DAO will provide a comprehensive, 360-degree view of the smart contract threat landscape, involves the community in the scoring process, and makes DeFi easier and more accessible by offering a standard of safety that users can trust. 

It will function as the first DeFi risk assessment tool for users to make smarter and safer decisions. Community members can provide qualitative suggestions on potential composability risks for various projects and fill metrics. 

The community will be incentivized to contribute qualitative and quantitative information on smart contract, centralization, and other DeFi risks. Team members will be sourced from the DAO and assembled to work on specific risk assessment tasks or setup as mini teams to perform comprehensive assessments. 

### Crowdsourced / Self-reported DeFi Scores

The main inputs in calculating the DeFi Score 2.0 are:

- Smart Contract Risk - Technical bugs that can expose funds to hackers.
    - Example Metrics: Audit history, critical hack history and responses (from hack incident reporting), DeFi Score 2.0 audits.
- Centralization Risk - Centralized admin keys are stolen or used nefariously, or oracles are manipulated to allow an exploit.
    - Example Metrics: Admin keys, timelock for protocol changes, whale concentration, percentage of staked tokens, % TVL from own tokens.
- Financial Risk - Collateral falls below outstanding obligations, likely due to price movement, or low liquidity leads to locked funds.
    - Example Metrics: Combined liquidity across dexes, 24-hour volume, volatility and impermanent loss measured over time.

The creation of guidelines will fuel a community driven initiative based on user ratings, providing  measurement of DeFi protocol scores defined by adaptable objective metrics and risk methodologies, updated by teams, contributors and the community.

Protocols that want to be listed should be able to complete a prospective rating themselves, and submit to the DAO for verification and approval. Alternatively, protocols should be able to offer grants for crowd sourced completion of ratings. 

To help get things started, ConsenSys Codefi will also:
*   Provide more helpful tools to the site, such as charts
*   Source valuable data to make scoring more accurate
*   Encourage meaningful community participation
*   Add additional communications support as needed

Soon a decentralized community of contributors will form to maintain this important infrastructure.

### Gitcoin Bounties

Continued improvements on DeFi scoring with bounties for clear, specific, predictable data. Sample draft SOPs are provided below in the "Risk Factors Database and SOPs" section.

### Coordinape
Enables decentralized and transparent distribution of rewards autonomously allocated by the community of contributors doing the work. This will provide insights on what the community finds most valuable, and who the key contributors are in different areas. Their aim is to make the experience of contributors more dynamic, rewarding, fair and transparent. 

Teams of DAO members working on particular tasks will be assembled into “Circles''. Circles could be specialized based on the task/risk being assessed; or they could be set up as mini teams that perform comprehensive assessments. Circles will be assigned a budget for each task/project, to be paid when complete. Total rewards are then divided amongst the members of the Circle based on contribution. 

For crowdsourcing to be effective, it is important to ensure that:

*   the quality of input meets a certain minimum standard, and 
*   a mechanism should exist which continuously improves the quality of input

To address this, a credibility score may be implemented.

#### **Credibility of Auditors and Assessors**

Circles/individuals may be rated on a constantly optimized credibility score. The credibility score will be composed of:

*   Experience score - how many audits completed/how much work done
*   Quality score - Did the audit prevent hacks? The longer the audited projects go without any exploits, the quality score of the individual/circle who completed the audit goes up

Protocols can restrict takers for their crowd sourced audits based on credibility score. Also, payment for services will be based on the credibility score of the individual/circle performing the work.

#### **Organization Details**

**Hives:** Collection of circles that perform the same generalized function.

**Circles:** Autonomous teams with specialized expertise whose responsibilities are clearly delineated. All members of a Circle act as peers. 

**Structure:**

Hive A: Smart Contract Risk assessors

Hive B: Centralization Risk assessors

Hive C: Financial Risk assessors

Hive D: Mitigation Measures assessors

Within each Hive, there will be specialized expertise circles for:

Circle 1: Lending platforms

Circle 2: Trading platforms

Circle 3: Yield farming platforms

**Audit Circles:** Circles can be specialized based on Audit tools used or by parts of the Audit split by expertise type (like with DeFi score circles above)

### 3rd Party Composite Score

Composite risk rating defined by compiling other DeFi safety scores which can be crowdsourced or automatically generated.

A list of DeFi ratings, which the DAO can leverage:
*   [DeFi Score](https://defiscore.io/) - A 1-10 grade on the smart contract, centralization, and financial risk of lending protocols
*   [Economic Safety Grade from DeFi Pulse & Gauntlet](https://defipulse.com/blog/introducing-the-defi-pulse-economic-safety-grade/) - A 1-100 grade to quantify and compare the economic risks of using on-chain protocols
*   [DeFi Safety](https://defisafety.com/) - A 1-100 rating of smart contract quality and safety for DeFi apps
*   [Certik Security Scores](https://www.certik.org/) - A 1-100 score of protocols across on-chain monitoring, social sentiment, governance changes, and market volatility
*   [CER Security Score](https://cer.live/defi) - A 1-10 score on protocols based on audits, bug bounties, and liquidity
*   [CoinGecko Trust Score](https://www.coingecko.com/en/methodology) - A 1-10 score on centralized exchanges as well as a Green/Yellow/Red rating of the liquidity of certain trading pairs

### Crowdsourced Audits

Crowd-sourced audits are ground-breaking and need to be defined carefully, but proactive cybersecurity is necessary in DeFi. 

One of the easiest ways to achieve protocol security is by providing rigorous crowd sourced audits in addition to bug bounties that are big enough to incentivize hackers to opt for the whitehat approach over blackhat. 

Protocols can pay for crowd sourced audits. Members of the DAO will conduct audits and report results, which will include bugs, proposed fixes, time spent on the audit and tools used.

Audits can be completed on request by the protocol (paid job); or complete audits and/or parts of audits can be completed by individuals as research to build their credibility on the platform (free jobs). 

Autonomous contributors can work on specific risk assessment tasks or perform comprehensive assessments.

### Defi Risk Glossary & Knowledge Base

Hacks vs exploits vs rugs vs scams, with detailed definitions and prevention strategies. Positive DeFi/DAO best practices for new and current projects to build on. Definition of DeFi risk factors used in the model.

### Hack Event Registry

An accessible resource for learning about past DeFi vulnerabilities/exploits and helping prevent them in the future.

### Pooled Bug Bounties

Aggregate bug bounties across protocols. Bounty hunters will be incentivized to hunt for critical vulnerabilities and be rewarded in the process. Armor and Immunefi have already been working with ecosystem protocols on a [Big Bug Bounty Challenge](https://medium.com/armorfi/announcing-the-armor-alliance-big-bug-bounty-challenge-56b2dcb12131). Protocols can offer bug bounties on Immunefi for exposure to a larger pool of interested whitehat hackers. 

# Risk Factors Database and SOPs

Objective: Adapt [https://defiscore.io/](https://defiscore.io/) and [https://inspect.codefi.network/](https://inspect.codefi.network/)  to the current DeFi landscape for measuring protocol risks with decentralized contributor model. We’ve put together a list of risk factors that can be used as a base to build upon an improved and robust DeFi scoring system.

We are looking for a solution that has the ability to:
*   Aggregate data points for each risk factor from existing reputable and reliable sources (automatically or crowd sourced)
*   Validate or invalidate the source of the data
*   Automate or implement a trigger based process from validating and updating data
*   Add/remove/hide risk factor data points
*   Generate an overall 0-10 score based on parameters set for each protocol
*   Display risk factor data and score for each protocol into a simple, easy to understand, easy to user interface.

Below, you can find the risk factor data points that we put together including sample data, and steps for generating the data manually. [Click here to view data for the Top 10 DeFi protocols](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qjeCGdwTmuHhFpSjc0ssIZp9Hf2hVOTA95GWyKjxrXQ/edit?usp=sharing) based on the risk factor data points listed below. Feedback and improvements are most welcome.

Admin Keys are held by platform administrators who have the ability to modify the rules of the contract in an arbitrary manner. Most administration keys are securely secured by features like Timelock and Multisig. However, no DeFi project can provide that the operational security of administration key is strong, so users need to rely on the expertise of the team and their ability to protect administration keys.

<p>
Liquidity is the degree of which an asset can be quickly bought or sold without affecting the general stability of its price. In other words, it refers to the ability to convert the asset into cash. A higher liquidity is preferred because of the fair price advantage and market stability.
<p>
Volume refers to the amount of activity of a token, may that be buying or selling within a period of time, eg. 24 hours. Generally high trading volume is considered a good thing. It shows that the market has liquidity and stability.
